# Notes about contents...
My Repo is jewrepo, the laniks are another dev that makes a great cleaning addon, that cleaning addon is Kcleaner and the version i have here is my own custom quick fix version of it to make it work proper on Kodi 20 with no debug log issues. (I Also made changes to the lanik python 3 repo addon.xml file in order to fix the annoying debug stuff it causes due to its http use when it should be https. but the .xml files version is still 1.0.0 instead of 1.0.0a like the zip label, not sure if it will matter or function that way but regardless the modified .xml file can simply be copied over to the normal working legit python 3 version repo folder and will work how i meant it to lmao.)
